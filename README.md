**Generate SQL migrations from GORM models**

Nib is a database migration CLI marrying [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) models to [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) migrations. [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org), SQLAlchemy's database migration tool, inspired this project.
